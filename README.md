Alien Game is an action game that has our protagonist stuck on an Alien Mothership as a prisoner. He has to move up the rankings to take over the Alien Mothership but will have to use the weapons of Aliens to move across and win against the extraterrestials. The catch is that each weapon will decrease our blood levels due to the toxicity of them. Use each weapon wisely and return when needed, or else... 

GAME OVER!

Every action will have consequences so choose wisely.

In the system, we have the user input his name so each decision feels personal and makes the player want to choose wisely without losing the game. With User class, we implement the use blood effect so it can affectively track our blood loss as we go on to ensure a user can lose eventually if the wrong decisions are made.

Our inventory class uses many definitions to help the user choose their weapons and also check what is stored so they can assess the situation and see what will be easier to move on with.

Our item class has each weapon that we listed stored with attributes like blood loss to have the player thinking about what to use. 

Each player starts off with 100 points of blood, and has to choose weapons that can help them complete the mission without falling to toxins while also managing HP when you go battle the other aliens.
Each weapon varies in blood cost and effectiveness. The player has to balance their limited blood supply effectively or they risk death.

The GameManager class will help us manage our choices throughout the story with letting us steal and return items and tell us which item is available for use.

The Story class will manage the enemies we face throughout the game applying each weapon that can defeat an enemy. We also have set up the certain points in the game that we have to navigate through called "Chambers".

The Main Script will have us put everything together to have the game function with a built in CLI that helps the game be user friendly for the player and importing SQLite will track the users inputs.

Our database file will track all of our borrowing A.K.A stealing system inputs while also tracking the players name input to match for records.

We hope you will enjoy our game as much as we have enjoyed developing it together as it has been an incredible journey. We wish you will on your voyage to save the world!
